Documenting the process of making the classic cheese version...

###Acknowledgments
First off, I wanna give props to the Pennywise cook
(http://pennywisecook.com/stuffed-pizza-cupcakes/) for leading me to the
idea of this form. I am still working with getting it just right, but so
far, this is the best form I've tried. So thanks!

###The Sauce
No picture for this one, sorry. But the basic sauce I used was the one
by Alton Brown
(http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/tomato-sauce-recipe/index.html).
It takes maybe 30 minutes of prepping the ingredients (tomatoes, onions,
and garlic), and then 2 hours of cooking, and another 10 minutes of
blending, but man, it's tasty! Just make sure to find the right
saltyness balance.


###Your Workstation

Baking is a zen thing. Get your workstation clean and ready for what's
coming. I swear, it makes a difference in the final taste! Haha.


###Make Your Dough
<img src="/images/dough-rising.jpg" alt="dough-rising">
Other instructions for how to make dough from scratch can be found on
the internet... Or, I guess, if you have the ability, you can buy dough
from your local bakery... But making the dough is one of my favourite
parts! It makes you a lot more intimate with your final product...


###Ingredients

Prep your toppings and garnishes while you wait for the dough to finish
rising.


###Top it Off!

Put your sauce and toppings on your dough, just like a normal pizza.


###Roll it Up!

Take care with rolling. It's like sushi: you want something nice and
firm and consistent, not something loose and sloppy.


###Slice

Your slices should be as wide as your cupcake mold is tall...



###Place in the Cupcake Mold
Sorry, don't have a picture of this... but take one of the slices, and
turn it sideways, like when a tire falls down...


###Bake
<img src="/images/baking.jpg" alt="baking">
Baking time and temperature is still a workin in progress... I was using
250 deg C, and waiting until the crust started to brown...


###Enjoy
After they are finished baking, let them cool for 5 minutes before
digging in. It's hard to wait that long, I know, but it makes a
difference...
